The ESP32 is a versatile and powerful microcontroller that offers a wide range of capabilities, including the ability to send notifications to users. Whether you want to notify someone about a specific event, update them on sensor data, or alert them to a critical situation, the ESP32 provides a convenient and efficient way to accomplish this. In this introduction, we will explore some of the methods and technologies you can use to send notifications using the ESP32.

One of the most common methods to send notifications from an ESP32 is through the use of internet connectivity. The ESP32 has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, making it well-suited for connecting to various online services and platforms. You can leverage these capabilities to send notifications through services like email, SMS, or even through cloud-based messaging platforms like MQTT or Firebase Cloud Messaging.
To get an email from ESP32 we need ESP32 item, a phone, the software arduino IDE, and a computer.
we need email account, I recommand not to use your personal email account to do this experience because if something goes wrong that will affect your account.
After creating your gmail account, you need allow less secure apps ON.

 Connect the ESP32 to the computer and open the arduino software to verify that all the sittings are correctly connected. The wifi and the port "COM3"

 Now you start coding but before that we will sketch. Our phone will get the notification.
 Now let go to the coding section

 By doing that you can modify the setting so that you will get nodification when for example the weather is cold.


The ESP32's flexibility and connectivity options make it a valuable tool for sending notifications in a wide array of applications. The ease of integration, coupled with a strong online community and a wealth of resources, makes the ESP32 an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

As you embark on your project, keep in mind that the specific notification method you choose should align with your project's requirements and the preferences of your end users. With careful planning and implementation, the ESP32 can be a reliable and efficient means of keeping users informed and updated about important events or data, enhancing the functionality and user experience of your project.
