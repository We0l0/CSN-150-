The ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.
In this project, we will explore seven different ways to send notifications using the ESP32. Notifications can be sent to various devices, such as smartphones, email, and other ESP32 devices, to alert users about specific events or conditions.
This project will help ypu understand the versatility of the ESP32 and how it can be integrated into various notification system.
Materials Needed:

The ESP32 Development Board is a powerful and versatile microcontroller platform that has gained immense popularity in the world of electronics and Lot (Internet of Things) development.
Developes by Espressif Systems, the ESP32 is the successor to the ESP8266, and it offers a wide range of features and capabilities that make it an exellent choice for a variety of projects.
Here are some key features and aspects of the ESP32 development board:
1. Dual-Core Processor: One of the standout features of the ESP32 is its dual-core Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor, which allows for multitasking and handling more complex task. This is a signification improvement over its predecessor, the single-core ESP8266
2.
